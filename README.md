# 🥷 Granite Agent

Semi-autonomous SLM agent powered by IBM Granite.

Granite Agent is blazing fast leveraging Granite 3.3 2B model.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Web Search:** Injects live data into the model context to ensure factual accuracy and eliminate hallucinations.

- **Deep Scraping:** System uses Browser-impersonation scraping to bypass bot protections and deep-read articles.
  
- **VRAM Optimization:** Engineered for consumer hardware using 4-bit quantization and rolling history window.
  
- **Plain-Text:** Strips away Markdown and complex formatting to focus model's attention on raw logic and data.
  
- **Memory Management:** Implements hard cache flushing and manual garbage collection to maintain stability.

- **Reasoning:** Employs dedicated <think> block for step-by-step logic before delivering the final result.

- **Uncensored:** Fused with specialized LoRA adapter for unrestricted access to sensitive data.
