- **Reasoning:** Employs dedicated <think> block for step-by-step logic before delivering the final result.

- **Uncensored:** Fused with specialized LoRA adapter for unrestricted access to sensitive data.

- **Deep Scraping:** System uses Browser-impersonation scraping to bypass bot protection.

- **Plain-Text:** Strips away complex formatting to focus model's attention on raw logic.

- **VRAM Optimization:** Engineered for consumer hardware using 4-bit quantization.
