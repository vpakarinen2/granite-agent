User: search latest news about US-Israeli attack on Iran today

Okay, let me start by analyzing the provided sources to find the most recent news articles about the US-Israeli attacks on Iran. 

First, looking at source [1], it mentions that "The death toll from a US - Israeli missile strike on a girls’ school in southern Iran has risen to almost 150..." with details like 133 civilian deaths and 200 injuries. This seems to be a significant event.

Source [2] also talks about the same incident, confirming the death toll as 150+ civilians. It includes quotes from Iranian officials stating they were targeting military sites but civilians were harmed. There's also mention of Iran retaliating after the attacks.

Sources [5] and [6] discuss the US acknowledging there was no prior intel about Iran planning an attack against them, which adds context to the timing of these strikes. Source [7] is a TASS article citing Russian sources saying the US admitted there was no intelligence about Iran planning to attack first, which aligns with [5].

So, putting all this together, the main sources discussing the US-Israeli attacks on Iran include [1][2][5][6]. They report high casualties among civilians and Iran's retaliatory actions following the strikes. The key takeaway is the severity of the attacks and subsequent Iranian responses.
